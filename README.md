# RoboBrew Alternative Controller

One of the great things about the RoboBrew is the cost, but the challenge is the built in controller. It's nice enough, but can't do any automation. Since I've mostly stopped using mine for time/kids/frustration reasons. I want to be able to use it with a bit more control. This is my first pass on the whole thing.

The goal is to take the existing relays and temperature sensor and use a Rasbperry PI to provide a more useful GUI interface. This is a work in progress, and will be updated as I go.
